## Features

* Modular microservices architecture
* Asynchronous messaging with **RabbitMQ**
* Centralized API routing with **Ocelot**
* Structured logging with **Serilog**
* User authentication and email confirmation flow
* PostgreSQL integration with **Entity Framework Core**
* Transactional email simulation
* Caching support with **Redis**
* Automated unit testing with **xUnit**
* Dockerized services for easy deployment
* CI/CD with **GitHub Actions**
* Cloud-ready (AWS compatible)

## Architecture

The system consists of the following microservices:

1. **Authentication Service**: Manages user registration, authentication, and JWT token issuance.
2. **User Service**: Handles user profile management and email confirmation.
3. **Wallet Service**: Manages user wallets and balances.
4. **Transaction Service**: Handles financial transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and payments.
5. **Notification Service**: Simulates sending transactional emails (e.g., email confirmations).
6. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to the appropriate microservices and handles authentication and rate limiting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### 1. Run Docker Infrastructure

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the **RabbitMQ** broker, **PostgreSQL** databases used by the services and **Redis** for caching.

### 2. Run the Microservices

Each service has its own solution and follows a layered architecture. You can run them individually:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run --project Authentication/Authentication.Api
dotnet run --project User/User.Api
dotnet run --project Wallet/Wallet.Api
dotnet run --project Transaction/Transaction.Api
dotnet run --project Notification/Notification.Api
dotnet run --project ApiGateway/ApiGateway.Api
```

## Usage

You can interact with the services using the Swagger UI or any HTTP client through the API Gateway:
